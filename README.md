# 🧬 Aging Gene Expression Analysis with R

This project explores aging-associated differential gene expression and functional enrichment using human transcriptomic data from the GEO database. It applies traditional bioinformatics pipelines and demonstrates reproducible analysis in R, aligning with the research interests of longevity and healthspan.

## 📚 Overview

- 🔍 Dataset: [GSE11882](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE11882) – Human tissues from young vs. old individuals.
- 🛠️ Tools: R, Bioconductor packages (`limma`, `EnhancedVolcano`, `clusterProfiler`, `org.Hs.eg.db`)
- 🎯 Goals:
  - Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in aging
  - Perform GO enrichment analysis to reveal biological processes involved
  - Visualize findings for scientific communication
